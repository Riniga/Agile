        p#descriptionThe ability to detect and recover from unforeseen production incidents is critical to the Continuous Delivery Pipeline. 
        p#rate Please rate your team's effectiveness at proactively detecting high severity production issues, identifying root causes using monitoring systems and quickly resolving issues by building, testing and deploying fixes through the pipeline (versus applying changes directly in production).

        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Customers find issues before we do; resolving high priority issues is time consuming and reactive; customers have low confidence in our ability to recover from production issues.

        input#radio1.form-check-input(type='radio' name='answer' value="2")
        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Operations owns production issues; development involvement requires significant escalation; teams blame each other in times of crisis.

        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Development and Operations collectively own the incident resolution process; recovering from major incidents is reactive but a team effort.

        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Our monitoring systems detect most issues before our customers do; Dev and Ops work proactively to recover from major incidents.
      .form-check
        input#radio1.form-check-input(type='radio' name='answer' value="5")
        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Our monitoring systems alert us to dangerous conditions based on carefully-designed tolerance thresholds; Developers are responsible for supporting their own code and proactively issue fixes through the pipeline before users are affected.
