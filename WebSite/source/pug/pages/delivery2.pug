        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Deployments are verified with manual tests prior to releasing to end users; rolling back is painful or impossible; we do not make changes directly in production.

        input#radio1.form-check-input(type='radio' name='answer' value="4")
        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Deployments are verified using automated smoke tests, synthetic transactions and penetration tests prior to release; we can easily roll back or fix forward to recover from failed deployments.
      .form-check
        input#radio1.form-check-input(type='radio' name='answer' value="5")
        label.form-check-label(for='radio1') Automated production tests run on an ongoing basis and feed monitoring systems; failed deployments can be rolled back instantly or fixed forward through the entire pipeline.
